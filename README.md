## Hi there, I'm Kenzie! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm an AI and data enthusiast with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Here, you'll find code snippets and experiments as I explore these fields and build practical skills along the way.

Through my college studies, I'm diving into advanced AI concepts, algorithms, and data structures, while also working on projects to deepen my understanding. 

I'm continuously learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks to grow within the data science ecosystem.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have something exciting to share.

I'm always happy to connect!
